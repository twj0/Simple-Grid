## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- MATLAB (R2022b or newer)
- Simulink (optional - automatic fallback available)
- Deep Learning Toolbox
- Reinforcement Learning Toolbox

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Simple_Microgrid.git
   cd Simple_Microgrid/proj
   ```

2. **One-Click Launch (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Double-click the main launcher
   quick_start.bat
   ```

3. **Or use MATLAB directly**
   ```matlab
   cd 'path/to/Simple_Microgrid/proj/main'
   setup_project_paths

   % Quick training (5 minutes)
   train_microgrid_drl('quick', 'ddpg')

   % Research training (2 hours)
   train_microgrid_drl('research', 'td3')

   % Analyze results
   analyze_results('all')
   ```

### 🚀 Configurable Training Options

The enhanced `quick_start.bat` provides flexible training configurations:

```
=== Configurable DRL Training ===
3. Quick Training (1 day, 5 episodes, ~5 minutes)
4. Default Training (7 days, 50 episodes, ~30 minutes)
5. Research Training (30 days, 100 episodes, ~2 hours)
6. Extended Training (90 days, 500 episodes, ~1 day)
7. Algorithm Comparison (DDPG vs TD3 vs SAC)

=== Analysis & Evaluation ===
8. Analyze DRL Results
9. Run Interactive MATLAB Menu
```

**Each training option allows algorithm selection:**
- 1. DDPG (baseline)
- 2. TD3 (improved stability)
- 3. SAC (maximum entropy)

### 🎯 Training Configurations

| Configuration | Days | Episodes | Time | Use Case |
|---------------|------|----------|------|----------|
| **quick** | 1 | 5 | ~5 min | Testing & validation |
| **default** | 7 | 50 | ~30 min | Regular training |
| **research** | 30 | 100 | ~2 hours | Research papers |
| **comparison** | 30 | 200 | ~4 hours | Algorithm comparison |
| **extended** | 90 | 500 | ~1 day | Comprehensive analysis |
