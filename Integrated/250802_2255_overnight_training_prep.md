# Overnight Training Preparation & To-Do List

**Date:** 2025-08-02 22:55

## Current Status
The `run_drl_experiment.m` script has been prepared for a long, overnight training session by increasing the maximum number of episodes.

## Critical Issue & Required Action
The primary obstacle to successful training is a **Simulink model configuration issue**.

- **Problem**: The RL agent is receiving a single, bundled "bus" signal instead of the 7 required observation signals. This is confirmed by the training log error: `obs size: [1 1]`.
- **Cause**: This happens because the 7 signals entering the `Mux` block have inconsistent sample times. Even though it is a `Mux` block, Simulink creates a "virtual bus" under these conditions.
- **Required Solution**: To fix this, the Simulink model (`Microgrid2508020734.slx`) must be modified as follows:
    1.  Delete any existing `ZOH` or `NoOp` blocks before the observation `Mux` block.
    2.  Insert a **`Rate Transition`** block on **each of the 7** signal lines that feed into the `Mux` block.
    3.  Configure each of these 7 `Rate Transition` blocks to have an **Output port sample time** of `Ts`.

**Note:** Without this change in the Simulink model, the agent will not learn, regardless of how long the training runs. The script has been correctly configured to expect 7 observations.
